# Interactive Visualization
Final project for web design class in 2021. 

## Implementation
Built using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `Javscript`

## Explanation 
The requirements for the assignment were: 
<blockquote> You will use Javascript to create interactive art or an interactive visualization.

Your goal is to make something that is worth interacting with for at least a minute. In other words: one button that does one thing is going to be interesting for about 5 seconds. But with multiple interactive elements, you'll keep the audience's attention.</blockquote>

There is only one HTML file for this project, though there are threr "pages" corresponding with the different times of day. Everything that changes does so using Javascript, and the Music Box is fully functional with a different song for each time of day as well.
